## Did You Know...

- The guitar is a transposing instrument; that is, music for guitars is notated one octave higher than the true pitch.
- The US time and frequency station [WWV](https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/time-distribution/radio-station-wwv/history-radio-station-wwv) broadcasts a 440 Hz signal at two minutes past every hour, with WWVH broadcasting the same tone at the first minute past every hour. This was added in 1936 to aid orchestras in tuning their instruments.
