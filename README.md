# Tuner

## Did You Know...

- The ppitch standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard)#cite_note-11)) used for tuning is A4 which has a frequency of 440 Hz, otherwise known as "A440".
- The US time and frequency station WWV broadcasts a 440 Hz signal at two minutes past every hour, with WWVH broadcasting the same tone at the first minute past every hour. This was added in 1936 to aid orchestras in tuning their instruments.[https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/time-distribution/radio-station-wwv/history-radio-station-wwv]
